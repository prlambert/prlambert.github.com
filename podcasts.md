# Podcasts I like

*Last updated: November 2019*

I like podcasts a lot – they are a direct connection to some really smart people and make commuting so much more satisfying. 

**Podcasts I subscribe to and listen to most episodes**

* [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm/) – Fantastic storytelling of some of the biggest success stories in tech these days. 
* [EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org/) – The most intellectually stimulating podcast I know. 
* [Exponent](https://exponent.fm/) – Ben Thompson's podcast. Strategic analysis of the tech ecosystem. 
* [Invest Like The Best](http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/)
* [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/)
* [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/) - Dan Carlin is in a league of his own. 

**Podcast documentaries I've completed**

* [S-town](https://stownpodcast.org/) – really loved this one
