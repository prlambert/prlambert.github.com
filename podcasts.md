# Podcasts I like

*Last updated: November 2019*

I like podcasts. They're a direct connection to some really smart people. They feel like blogs did 10 years ago.

**Podcasts I subscribe to and listen to every episode**

* [EconTalk](https://www.econtalk.org/)
* [Acquired](https://www.acquired.fm/)
* [Exponent](https://exponent.fm/)
* [Invest Like The Best](http://investorfieldguide.com/podcast/)
* [Internet History Podcast](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/)
* [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)

Hardcore History is phenomenal, Dan Carlin is in a league of his own. 
Econtalk is the most intellectually stimulating. Acquired was the biggest influence on a podcast I'm currently working on with [Aakash Sahney](https://twitter.com/aakashsahney?lang=en) (tentatively called "Product Post-Mortem"). 

**Podcast documentaries I've completed**

* [S-town](https://stownpodcast.org/)
* [Containers](https://medium.com/containers/episode-1-welcome-to-global-capitalism-f9f56c92f414)

S-town really touched me. 

**Podcasts I like, but end up missing most episodes**

* [LSE: Public lectures and events](https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/duvpa-2f030/LSE-Public-lectures-and-events-Podcast)
* [Trade Talks](https://www.tradetalkspodcast.com/)
* And of course, the grandaddy of podcasts, [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/)
