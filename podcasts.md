# Podcasts I like

*Last updated: December 2019*

I like podcasts. They feel like blogs did 10 years ago. They're a chance to connect with and learn from some really smart people.

Unlike my bookshelf, I've listed to most of this list.

**Podcasts I subscribe to and try to listen to everyepisode**

* Econtalk
* Acquired
* Exponent
* Invest Like The Best
* The Talk Show
* Internet History Podcast


**Podcast documentaries**

* S-town
* Hardcore History
* Containers

S-town really touched me. Hardcore History is absolutely phenomenal, Dan Carlin is in a league of his own. 

**Podcasts have listened to and like, but end up skipping most episodes**

* LSE public lectures
* This American Life
* TradeTalks
* MacroMusings
