Hi, I'm Paul. 

This is my about page. I find writing about pages pretty awkward, so I'll keep this short. 

* [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrolandlambert/): Accurate, but not always up to date. 
* [My Twitter](https://twitter.com/prlambert): A good way to message me. If you send me a tweet, I'll see it. I'll probably even reply.
* My email is pr@prlambert.com. Feel free to drop me a line, assuming you are a human. 

I'm currently a Product Manager at Google living in Redwood City, just outside San Francisco . Before Google, I was a PM at Twitter for two years. Before Twitter, I was the founding CEO at [Learndot](http://www.learndot.com/) for five years. I'm originally from Calgary. Over the course of 2005-2008 I spent two years in Beijing. 

Thanks for reading!
