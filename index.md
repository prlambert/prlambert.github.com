Hi, I'm Paul. 

I live in Silicon Valley and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Canada</a>. I'm a Partner at <a href="https://area120.google.com/">Area 120</a>, Google's internal early stage fund and startup incubator. 

I began my career as an entrepreneur. In 2009, I cofounded <a href="https://www.learndot.com/">Learndot</a> and was CEO for 5 years. Before that I developed a tech-enabled translation service in China during the run up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

After selling Learndot in 2014 to a company in Palo Alto, I had the chance to move to California. Finally, after years being on the outside looking in, I was in the center of the (my) universe. I wanted to learn from the best. I wanted to work on products used by hundreds of millions of people. So I became a Product Manager â€“ first at Twitter to work on growth for the core product and then at Google to work on Gmail. I led the development of AI features for Gmail and started some well-know projects including Smart Compose.
