Hi, I'm Paul. 

I'm a Partner at [Area 120](https://area120.google.com), Google's internal early stage fund and startup incubator. I live in Silicon Valley and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Canada</a>.

I started my career as an entrepreneur. In 2009, I cofounded <a href="https://www.learndot.com/">Learndot</a>, a learning technology company, and was CEO for 5 years. You can learn more about that time in the [Blog Archive](/blog/). Before Learndot (and right after university), I developed a tech-enabled translation service in China ahead of the Beijing Olympics. 

In 2014, Learndot was acquired by a company in Palo Alto and I had the chance to move to California. Finally, after years being on the outside looking in, I felt like I was in the center of the universe. I wanted to learn from the best and work on software used by hundreds of millions of people. So I became a Product Manager â€“ first at Twitter, to work on Growth, and then at Google, where I developed Machine Learning powered features for Gmail.

After five years as a PM, I wanted to get back to entrepreneurship, do more investing, and study innovation. Area 120 was a perfect fit.
