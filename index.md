Hi, I'm Paul. 

I'm a Partner at <a href="https://area120.google.com/">Area 120</a>, Google's internal early stage fund and startup incubator. I live in Silicon Valley and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Canada</a>.

I began my career as an entrepreneur. In 2009, I cofounded <a href="https://www.learndot.com/">Learndot</a>, a learning technology company, and was CEO for 5 years. Before that I developed a tech-enabled translation service in China ahead of the Beijing Olympics. 

In 2014, Learndot was acquired by a company in Palo Alto. Finally, after years being on the outside looking in, I felt like I was in the center of the universe. I wanted to learn from the best and work on software used by hundreds of millions of people. So I became a Product Manager – first at Twitter to work on Growth and then at Google to work on Gmail and Machine Learning.

After five years as a PM, I wanted to get back to my entrepreneurial roots and had also developed a deep interest in innovation theory. Area 120 was a perfect fit.
