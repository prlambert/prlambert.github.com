Hi, I'm Paul. 

I live in Silicon Valley and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Canada</a>. I'm a Partner at <a href="https://area120.google.com/">Area 120</a>, Google's early stage fund for internal talent. 

I began my career as an entrepreneur. In 2009, I cofounded <a href="https://www.learndot.com/">Learndot</a> and was CEO for 5 years. Prior to Learndot, I developed a tech-enabled translation service in China during the run up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

After selling Learndot in 2014, I wanted to work on products used by hundreds of millions of people, so moved to California and became a Product Manager. I was a PM at Twitter for 2 years and then joined Google in 2016 where I led the the development of Smart Compose for Gmail and a number of other AI features.
