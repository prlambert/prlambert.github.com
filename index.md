Hi, I'm Paul. 

I'm a Partner at [Area 120](https://area120.google.com), Google's internal incubator. I live in the Bay Area and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary">Canada</a>.

I started my career as an entrepreneur. In 2009, I cofounded <a href="https://www.learndot.com/">Learndot</a>, a learning technology company, and was CEO for 5 years. You can learn more about that time in the [Blog Archive](/blog/). Before Learndot (and right after university), I developed a tech-enabled translation service in China ahead of the Beijing Olympics. 

In 2014, Learndot was acquired by a company in Palo Alto and I had the chance to move to California. Finding myself in Silicon Valley, I wanted to learn from the best and build products used by people around the world. I have been fortune to be able to do just that â€“ first at Twitter and now at Google. 

For more professional background, see my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrolandlambert/">LinkedIn</a>. I'm also a proud dad and husband. For more personal information, get to know me.
