Hi, I'm Paul.

Iâ€™m a Product Manager at Twitter living in San Francisco. Before Twitter, I was the founding CEO at Learndot from 2009 until January 2015, we when the company was acquired by Service Rocket.

I love what I do. One reason is because I get to dive into awesome areas like design, business, technology, and development. Naturally these are also the areas I tend to write about. 

I post to this site, [Medium](https://medium.com/@prlambert), and occasionally other blogs. [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/prlambert) to keep track. 

Wanna chat? [Tweeting at me](https://twitter.com/prlambert) will get you the quickest reply, but email works too: pr@prlambert.com.
