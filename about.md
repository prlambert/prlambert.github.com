![Passport Me](/images/paul-passport.jpg)

Hi, I'm Paul.

Iâ€™m a Product Manager at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) living in San Francisco. Before Twitter, I was the founding CEO at [Learndot](http://www.learndot.com/) from 2009 until January 2015.

I love what I do. I get to work with and learn from amazing people in design, business, technology, and communications every day. Naturally, these are the areas I like to write about too.  

I post to this site, [Medium](https://medium.com/@prlambert), and occasionally other blogs. [Following me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/prlambert) is the best way to keep track. 

Wanna chat? [Send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/prlambert) to get the quickest reply, but email usually works too: pr@prlambert.com.
