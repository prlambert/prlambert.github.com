Hi, I'm Paul.

Iâ€™m a Product Manager at Twitter living in San Francisco. Before Twitter, I was the founding CEO at [Learndot](http://www.learndot.com/) from 2009 until late 2014.

I was born in the snowy Canadian priarie city of Calgary, Alberta, in 1983. When I was five, my dad brought home a 386 running DOS. It came with a pack of 50 floppies, each loaded with a different shareware game and the computer soon became my favorite toy. It still is. As a teenager in the 90s, I taught myself HTML to make a Smashing Pumpkins fansite on Geocities. I also spent way too much time in [MUDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). 

Fortunately, I had some other interests too and they've also stuck with me: soccer (I still play, and am a huge Whitecaps FC fan), music (I play guitar and piano and have been in a couple bands), and languages (I grew up in Anglo-Canada going to French school and started studying Cantonese in high school). 

In 2001, I moved to Vancouver to attend UBC. I was reading a lot of Kurt Vonnegut that summer, so declared a double major in Anthropology (his major) and Creative Writing. After getting my BA in 2006, I moved to Beijing, China and started a translation company. I sold it in 2008, moved back to Vancouver, and did a second degree in Computer Science. In 2009, while in school, I started Learndot with my childhood best friend, [Joe Gaudet](https://twitter.com/joegaudet). It eventually led me to San Francisco.

In 2015, I joined Twitter as a PM in Growth, which [I wrote about](https://medium.com/@prlambert/selling-learndot-and-joining-twitter-4b39576d1b15) at the time. So far all my predictions from that post have become true. Twitter really is an amazing place to work.

Wanna chat? Can I be helpful? [Sending me a tweet](https://twitter.com/prlambert) is your best bet, but email usually works too: pr@prlambert.com.
