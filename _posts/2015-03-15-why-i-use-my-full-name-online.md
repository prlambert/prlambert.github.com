I’ve decided to use my full name, “Paul Roland Lambert” on the internet. If you know me in real life, I hope you just call me “Paul” like you always have. 

The reason is to be more discoverable by using a more unique name. Since I like to publish things online, I like to imagine that maybe people will want to find me in the future. Using Google, perhaps. But that’s hard right now, because there are a lot other people with my name. 

First of all, there’s a Scottish soccer coach.

Sometimes it leads to fun Twitter interactions like this one:

There’s also an actor from the sixties:

And this guy on LinkedIn who like to call himself a “visionary”:

So “Paul Roland Lambert” it is for me. At least online.
