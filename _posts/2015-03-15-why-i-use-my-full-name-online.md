I’ve decided to use my full name for my internet identity. Offline, I'm still going by “Paul,” like I always have. 

I like to imagine that if someone is looking for me online, they could find me. Using Google, perhaps. But that’s really hard right now, because there are a lot other people with my name. 

First of all, there’s a Scottish soccer coach.

Sometimes it leads to fun Twitter interactions like this one:

There’s also an actor from the sixties:

And this guy on LinkedIn who calls himself a “visionary”:

So “Paul Roland Lambert” it is for me. At least online.
