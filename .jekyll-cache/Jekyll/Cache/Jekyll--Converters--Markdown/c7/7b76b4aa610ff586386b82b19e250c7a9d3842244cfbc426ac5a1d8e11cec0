<p><em>Last updated: December 2019</em></p>

<p>I like podcasts. They feel like blogs did 10 years ago. Theyâ€™re a chance to connect with and learn from some really smart people.</p>

<p>Unlike my bookshelf, Iâ€™ve listed to most of this list.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasts I subscribe to and try to listen to everyepisode</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Econtalk</li>
  <li>Acquired</li>
  <li>Exponent</li>
  <li>Invest Like The Best</li>
  <li>The Talk Show</li>
  <li>Internet History Podcast</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Podcast documentaries</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>S-town</li>
  <li>Hardcore History</li>
  <li>Containers</li>
</ul>

<p>S-town really touched me. Hardcore History is absolutely phenomenal, Dan Carlin is in a league of his own.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasts have listened to and like, but end up skipping most episodes</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>LSE public lectures</li>
  <li>This American Life</li>
  <li>TradeTalks</li>
  <li>MacroMusings</li>
</ul>
