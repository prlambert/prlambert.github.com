I"<p>Hi, I’m Paul.</p>

<p>This is my about page. I find writing about pages pretty awkward, so I’ll keep this short.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulrolandlambert/">My LinkedIn</a>: Accurate, but not always up to date.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/prlambert">My Twitter</a>: A good way to message me. If you send me a tweet, I’ll see it. I’ll probably even reply.</li>
  <li>My email is pr@prlambert.com. Feel free to drop me a line, assuming you are a human.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m currently a Product Manager at Google living in Redwood City, just outside San Francisco . Before Google, I was a PM at Twitter for two years. Before Twitter, I was the founding CEO at <a href="http://www.learndot.com/">Learndot</a> for five years. I’m originally from Calgary. Over the course of 2005-2008 I spent two years in Beijing.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
